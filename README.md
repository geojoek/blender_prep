My modificiation of Nick Underwood's fabulous shell script (https://github.com/nunderwood6/blender_prep) to prepare DEMs for hillshading in Blender as per Daniel Huffman's amazing tutorial on how to do so (https://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/2017/11/16/creating-shaded-relief-in-blender/).

My main contribution is parameterizing the script and adding various creation options to optimize performance of GDAL command-line utilities.
